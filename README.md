# cst8130_javafx_assign4
A little program from my 2013 Object-oriented programming class that moves actor based shapes around on a LOTR map, with music.

    Requires Java 8 and jfxrt.jar in the buildpath.

It's buggy when it comes to trying to quit adding new actor objects, and probably other areas, but I was new and
it was probably the most fun I've had learning.
